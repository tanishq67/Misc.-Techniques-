I have seen two types of questions that occur in 2pointer

type 1 ->

FFFFFFFFTTTTTTFFFFFFFFFF

for a fixed i we are trying to find the j such that i and j shall contain all the Trues.
In case of counting think of this.


### Think about it more and add the questions.

type 2 ->

We are finding a pair simultaneously for a T.

Example# fixed value of the pair.
